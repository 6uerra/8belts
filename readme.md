## üéà Test <a name="test"></a>

The test scenarios are created in the feature file using Gherkin language. They are connected to a method in the StepDefinitions classes using annotations like @Given, @When, and @Then. The step definition methods are connected to Task classes for the Given and When steps, where high-level actions are performed. These Task classes can invoke Interactions classes for low-level actions. For the Then step, it communicates with Question classes to perform validations.
